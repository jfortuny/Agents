# Prospective models

To determine what Agents are good prospects for our Marketers we analyze relevant data to identify Agents that may become productive producers for AmeriLife. We do so by fitting primarily two types of models to the data:

* __Classification__ models trying to answer general questions that result in a Yes or No (Categorical) response: 
    + Will this Agent generate revenue for AmeriLife?
    + Will this Agent generate revenue for AmeriLife within six months of Contract?
    + Will this Agent generate a revenue stream for a period of, at least, two years from initial Contract?
* __Regression__ models that try to answer general questions that result in a numeric value (Continuous) response:
    + What's the time to first revenue for this Agent? How many months before this Agent generates revenue?
    + What is the revenue generated by this Agent withn the first year of Contract?
    + What is the lifetime revenue that we can expect from this Agent?

Along the way we will also use additional categories of models to corroborate the findings of the promary models and evaluate the primary model's performance.

## Model Predictors

To be able to answer the types of questions posed above we will use the following collection of predictors:

* Discovery Agent Demographic and Appointment Data
* Census Population and Household Data
* CSG Insurance Product Rates Data
* CRM Contract Data
* Pre-Processor Commission Data

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
